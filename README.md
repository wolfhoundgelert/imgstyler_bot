## The final project for the course "Deep Learning"
### Semester 1, autumn 2022 - https://stepik.org/course/124070/info
### Participant: Andrei Polkanov
# Telegram Bots - Styling images in a telegram bot

### Task:
```
Main part (one of two options):

Option 1:
- Write code for a simple model that can transfer style from one photo to another.
    You can use the slow algorithm that we talked about in our lesson.
- Make a bot that you can send two photos to and get a photo with the transferred style in return.

Additional part for option 1:
- Add the ability to transfer style using GANs.

Option 2:
- Write a code that improves the quality of a photo using GANs 
    (you can narrow the selection to some objects of the same type)
- Make a bot to which you can send a photo and receive a photo with improved quality in response

Additional part for option 2:
- Add the ability to improve the quality of photos of different objects (i.e. not of the same type)
